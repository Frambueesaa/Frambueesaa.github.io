            <p>
                I had been eyeing 
                <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a> for a while now. You might think, like most people,
                that it's because of the idea of creating a <span>AAA</span> game or at least simulating its graphics, but no — 
                if there's something developers love, it's challenges, and when it comes to code, I start 
                overthinking... probably more than I should. All of this, combined with some questionable policies 
                from <a href="https://unity.com" target="_blank">Unity</a>, 
                my main game engine, and my constant interest in <span>C++</span>, with its manual memory management — 
                also encouraged by opinions from some programmers I met at game dev events — led me to dive into this world.
            </p>

            <h2>Easy to start?</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve only been using <span>C++</span> for a few weeks and made just a few attempts with the engine and Blueprints. 
                From my experience with Unity, I can say it’s not easy. It's a very complete engine, no doubt about that, 
                and I haven’t even scratched the surface of what it offers — but it’s extremely complex, 
                especially for someone just starting out, at least with <span>C++</span>. From the <span>Blueprints</span> 
                perspective, it’s a bit more accessible. In fact, for 3D artists and game designers, 
                the engine is exactly what they need, since it offers a wide variety of tools that Unity, 
                at least natively, doesn’t include.
            </p>

            <section class="flexBox wrap">
                <article class="flex50">

            <h2>What about C++?</h2>
            <p>
                If you're coming from native C++, it’ll probably be easier for you than it was for me. But it’s true that
                Unreal Engine is a massive engine, so you'll need to learn a lot first about how it works and how 
                to implement things. This isn’t like Unity where you just create and drag — here, every class is strictly 
                tied to an object or a blueprint, or at least that’s what it seemed like to me in this brief first contact.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Will I continue with Unreal Engine?</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Obviously yes</span>. The engine is something that really catches my attention, and the visual results 
                it delivers so easily are incredible. I also love the idea Unreal maintains of combining Blueprints 
                with native C++ code. This way, when collaborating with another developer with less experience, 
                they can still contribute to the project easily. Plus, it’s great for rapid prototyping.
